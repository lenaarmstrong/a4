				Design Decisions and Rationale:

			<ul>
				<li>(2) Filtered out null values of FADO types and year received</li>
				<li>(-2) Added zero when there was no allegations for a type in a year to plot zero allegations for 2020 on the map</li>
				<li>(-2) Annotated that there were only 4 allegations in 2020 to highlight how few there were</li>
				<li>(-1) Used a shaded area graph to show the trends between FADO types</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		In the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests, democrats and republicans had different ideas about the role of 
		police officers in the United States and concern for the scale of police brutality. I wanted to explore how I could 
		create a counter-visual that would create the sense that police brutality in 2020 was decreasing and not as 
		problematic as some feared to see how data could be warped around different agendas. First, I filtered out allegations 
		that had null values for the FADO type and year received, which did not change the overall visualization and just 
		removed the “null” category, which didn't have additional information. Then, I experimented with more deceptive 
		tactics, such as adding zero when there were no allegations in a particular year for that type. While visualization 
		zero can be very helpful, especially to illuminate what is missing, in this case it visualizes data that wasn’t collected. 
		The data for 2020 only includes allegations in January as opposed to all twelve months like the other years, so by 
		visualizing 0 it suggests that there were no allegations in that year, when there might have been, but just were not 
		collected by the time this dataset was released. Furthermore, but annotating that there are only four allegations in 2020,
		 it emphasizes that there are so few allegations, but deceives the viewer by not mentioning that there were only for 
		 January 2020. I used an area graph to further highlight how all the lines decreased and merged in the single digits. 
		 The overall effect of this graph is that police violence and abuses decreased, but it obscures socio-political aspects 
		 of 2020 and what is the time period of the data.
