			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(2) Filtered out null values for the number of complaints, year received, and ethnicities </li>
				<li>(2) Filtered by force since police brutality is defined by excessive force</li>
				<li>(2) Included groups without complaints</li>
				<li>(1) Filtered 2010 - 2020 to show recent complaints</li>
				<li>(1) Choose color by number of civilian complaints</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				To show how police brutality is still a major problem in the United States, I visualized the number of 
				civilian complaints based on the ethnicity of the person who filed the complaint and the  ethnicity of 
				the police officer. First, I filtered out null values for the number of complaints, year received, and 
				ethnicities to remove “null” categories. Then, I filtered the FADO (Force, Abuse of Authority, Discourtesy, 
				and Offensive Language) type by force since police brutality is defined by excessive force and I didn’t 
				want to misrepresent the number of complaints of it. This did decrease the number of complaints against 
				White police officers by Black people from about 5,340 to 1,118, but felt like a more accurate depiction 
				of police violence. If I was trying to be deceptive, I may have included additional categories, but the 
				take-away and trends remain the same, showing how many cases of police brutality occur, especially against 
				Black and Hispanic people by White police officers. I also wanted to answer the question of how police brutality 
				“remains a problem” by filtering by the last ten years in the dataset; however, this number was arbitrarily 
				determined as recent and other choices may have shown slightly different numbers of complaints. I also chose to 
				include groups without complaints because I wanted to make sure more groups were represented by the visualization 
				and not excluded. In this way, it shows that groups that may have been excluded for having fewer complaints are 
				shown as not contributing to this phenomenon as opposed to leaving it up for debate. Additionally, I chose a 
				contrasting color scale from purple to red to better highlight how Black people are disproportionately affected 
				by police brutality. Other color choices, such as a gradient, may have made this less prominent, but I wanted to 
				show the stark differences between the groups and the extent of injustice.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
          This visualization shows how New York Police Department excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, and offensive language have changed over time from 1985 - 2020 with drastic decreases in 2019 and 2020. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(2) Filtered out null values of FADO types and year received</li>
				<li>(-2) Added zero when there was no allegations for a type in a year</li>
				<li>(-2) Annotated that there were only 4 allegations in 2020 to highlight how few there were</li>
				<li>(-1) Used a shaded area graph to show the trends between FADO types</li>
				<li>(-1) Counted "allegations"</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				In the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests, democrats and republicans had different ideas about the role of 
				police officers in the United States and concern for the scale of police brutality. I wanted to explore how I could 
				create a counter-visual that would create the sense that police brutality in 2020 was decreasing and not as 
				problematic as some feared to see how data could be warped around different agendas. First, I filtered out allegations 
				that had null values for the FADO type and year received, which did not change the overall visualization and just 
				removed the “null” category, which didn't have additional information. Then, I experimented with more deceptive 
				tactics, such as adding zero when there were no allegations in a particular year for that type. While visualization 
				zero can be very helpful, especially to illuminate what is missing, in this case it visualizes data that wasn’t collected. 
				The data for 2020 only includes allegations in January as opposed to all twelve months like the other years, so by 
				visualizing 0 it suggests that there were no allegations in that year, when there might have been, but just were not 
				collected by the time this dataset was released. Furthermore, but annotating that there are only four allegations in 2020,
				 it emphasizes that there are so few allegations, but deceives the viewer by not mentioning that there were only for 
				 January 2020. I used an area graph to further highlight how all the lines decreased and merged in the single digits. 
				 Additionally, I used the term "allegations" to refer to the cilivian complaints, even though ProPublica noted that they 
				 excluded allegations that were deemed unfounded or to have not occured, to add suspcicion that the numbers in the visualization
				 may be even lower in actuality. The overall effect of this graph is that police violence and abuses decreased, but 
				 it obscures socio-political aspects of 2020 and what is the time period of the data.
